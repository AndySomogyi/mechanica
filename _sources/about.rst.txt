The Mechanica modeling language (MML) enables construction of mechanistic models of natural
phenomena. MML is based on a functional subset of Microsoft Typescript, and includes conventional
constructs such as variables and functions, but adopts syntactic concepts from POVRay, a widely used
spatial scene description language for geometry description, and pattern matching rules inspired by
ideas from BioNetGen, OCaml and Mathematica.
