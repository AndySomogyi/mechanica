Mechanica
=========
Mechanica is an interactive particle based physics, chemistry and biology
simulation environment, with a heavy emphasis towards enabling users to model
and simulate complex sub-cellular and cellular biological physics
problems. Mechanica is part of the Tellurium
`<http://tellurium.analogmachine.org>`_ project.

Mechanica is designed first and foremost to enable users to work interactively
with simulations -- so they can build, and run a simulation in real-time, and
interact with that simulation whilst it's running. The goal is to create an
SolidWorks type environment where users can create and explore virtual models of
soft condensed matter physics, with a emphasis towards biological physics.

Mechanica is a native compiled C++ shared library with a native and extensive
Python API, that's designed to used from an ipython console (or via scripts of
course).
