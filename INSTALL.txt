PyPi install:

* the cmake copies all the bits to the 'mechanica' output folder

in the output dir:

python3 setup.py bdist_wheel

then have to rename the genrated wheel from

mechanica-0.0.2.dev4-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_14_x86_64.whl

to

mechanica-0.0.2.dev4-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_13_x86_64.whl

this makes it compatible with Mac 10.13. I build on Mac 10.13, no idea why it
insists on makeing a 10.14 named file, but works fine to rename it.

python3 -m twine upload dist/*
