 * @section sec_whatis What is mdcore?
 *
 * mdcore is an attempt to construct a general-purpose library containing
 * efficient implementations of the core routines required for Molecular Dynamics
 * simulations on shared-memory parallel architectures.
 *
 * These target architectures include
 * 
 * @li Multi-Core Processors,
 * @li The IBM Cell Broadband Engine,
 * @li CUDA-capable Graphics Processing Units.
 *
 * The goal of this project is not to provide yet another fully-featured simulation
 * software, but to provide shared-memory functionallity that can be easily
 * integrated into existing or future simulation codes.
 *
 * @section sec_using Using mdcore
 * 
 * The directory "mdcore/examples" contains a number of small
 * simulations which offer a useful starting point for experimenting
 * with mdcore and implementing your own simulation.
