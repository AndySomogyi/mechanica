Key Concepts
============

The first step in formalizing knowledge is writing it down in such a way that it
has semantic meaning for both humans and computers. This section will cover the
key concepts Mechancia provides that enable users to build models of physical
things.

The two key concepts we cover here are *objects* and *processes*. Objects are
logical representations of physical matter. We use a particle to represent
either individual things such as cells, molecules, etc, or particles can
represent clumps of matter, such a volume of fluid. Processes are the ways
objects interact with each other. Here we will cover the basic interaction
potentials that we provide, and will also cover reactions, fluxes and events.  


 .. _binding:

Binding
-------

Binding objects and processes together is one of the key ways to create a
Mechanica simulation. Binding is a very generic concept, but essentially it
serves to connect a process (such a potential, flux, reaction, etc..) with one
or more objects that that process should act on.
