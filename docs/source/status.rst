Status
======

Mechancia is very early in the development cycle, as such, it's *EXTREMLY*
feature-incomplete, unstable, and will almost certainly crash.

However, as such, this is YOUR chance to try it out, and let us know what kind
of features you'd like to see.

Features to be implemented
--------------------------

* Linux binaries
* mouse interction -- rotate, zoom simulation
* Documentation
* Event system to hook up simulation events to user objects
* User definable visualization style
* Nosé–Hoover thermostat
* Destroying particles
* Collision reactions (when particles collide, they react, and can create and
  destroy particles)
* Particle mitois
* attach chemical cargo to particles
* reaction-kinetics network at each particle
* Windows binaries
* Movable boundary conditions
* reflective boundary conditions (only have periodic now)
* mouse object picking
* Python API for bonded interactions (bonds, angles, dihedrals, impropers)


Known Bugs
----------

* In ipython, closing the window does not work correctly
* energy is not conserved -- bug in integrator.

Features for next release
-------------------------

* Python API for vertex model (polygons, cells)
