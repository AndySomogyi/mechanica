Network Object Model
--------------------

Reaction kinetics, flux and ODE netorks are the (??? really important thing
???). Something about chemical processes...

The Network Object Model (NOM) is a core component of the Carbon library that

* Enables the visual network renderer to represent and edit reaction kinetics models
* Users to attach networks to spatial objects
* Have the visual network user interface display and interact with a live,
  running simulation.
* is a way to represent, store and edit both the underlying structure of a
  reaction network, as well as interact with the values from a running simulation
*
